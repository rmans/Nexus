```

## Source Code (`src/`)

The main source code is organized under the `nexus` package:

```
src/
└── nexus/                     # Main package
    ├── commands/              # Command implementations
    ├── core/                  # Core functionality and business logic
    ├── docs/                  # Documentation files
    │   └── readmes/           # Modular README sections
    │       ├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
    │       ├── GETTING_STARTED.md
    │       ├── API_REFERENCE.md
    │       ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
    │       └── CHANGELOG.md
    └── instructions/          # Instruction definitions
```

### Package Structure Details

- **`commands/`**: Contains command-line interface implementations and command handlers
- **`core/`**: Houses the core business logic, data models, and main application functionality
- **`docs/`**: Project-specific documentation files
  - **`readmes/`**: Modular README sections for organized documentation
- **`instructions/`**: Instruction definitions and templates

## Testing (`test/`)

```
test/
├── results/                   # Test execution results and reports
└── scripts/                   # Test automation scripts
```

### Test Organization

- **`results/`**: Stores test output, reports, and execution logs
- **`scripts/`**: Contains automated test scripts and testing utilities

## Generated Documentation (`generated-docs/`)

This directory contains auto-generated documentation organized by category:

```
generated-docs/
├── arch/                      # Architecture documentation
├── exec/                      # Execution documentation
├── impl/                      # Implementation details
├── int/                       # Integration documentation
├── prd/                       # Product requirements documentation
├── rules/                     # Business rules and constraints
├── task/                      # Task definitions and workflows
└── tests/                     # Test documentation
```

### Documentation Categories

- **`arch/`**: System architecture diagrams, design documents, and technical specifications
- **`exec/`**: Execution flow documentation, runtime behavior, and operational procedures
- **`impl/`**: Implementation details, code documentation, and technical specifications
- **`int/`**: Integration guides, API documentation, and external system interfaces
- **`prd/`**: Product requirements, feature specifications, and user stories
- **`rules/`**: Business rules, validation logic, and constraint definitions
- **`task/`**: Task definitions, workflow documentation, and process descriptions
- **`tests/`**: Test documentation, test plans, and testing strategies

## Development Environment

- **`venv/`**: Python virtual environment for dependency isolation
- **`.gitignore`**: Git ignore rules for version control

## Project Status

Based on the current structure, this appears to be a Python project in early development stages with:

- Well-organized directory structure following Python best practices
- Comprehensive documentation generation system
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Testing infrastructure in place
- Virtual environment for dependency management

## Getting Started

1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies (if requirements file exists)
3. Run tests from the `test/` directory
4. Check generated documentation in `generated-docs/`
5. Read the modular documentation in `src/nexus/docs/readmes/`

## Documentation Structure

The project uses a modular documentation approach:

- **Main README**: Overview and navigation to all documentation sections
- **Modular READMEs**: Located in `src/nexus/docs/readmes/` for organized, focused content
- **Generated Docs**: Auto-generated technical documentation in `generated-docs/`

## Notes

- The project appears to be in early development with empty core directories
- Documentation is auto-generated and organized by category
- The structure suggests a command-line tool or application framework
- Testing infrastructure is prepared but may need implementation

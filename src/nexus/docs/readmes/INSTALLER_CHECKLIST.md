  - [ ] Support system package managers
  - [ ] Handle different Python versions

## Testing Phase

### Installation Testing
- [ ] **Clean Environment Testing**
  - [ ] Test on fresh system installations
  - [ ] Verify all dependencies are installed
  - [ ] Test with different Python versions
  - [ ] Test with different user permissions

- [ ] **Upgrade Testing**
  - [ ] Test upgrading from previous versions

  - [ ] Handle configuration migration
  - [ ] Test dependency updates

- [ ] **Uninstallation Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete removal
  - [ ] Verify no leftover files
  - [ ] Test configuration preservation
  - [ ] Test dependency cleanup

### User Scenarios
- [ ] **End User Installation**
  - [ ] Test with minimal technical knowledge
